### Gamemode: Capture the Flag

- Two teams compete to capture the opposing teamâ€™s flag and return it to their base.
- Players can respawn after being destroyed, according to the modeâ€™s respawn rules.
- The match is won by the team that reaches the required number of flag captures within the time limit or has the most captures when time expires.
- Damage is location-based; critical areas like ammunition storage are more vulnerable.
