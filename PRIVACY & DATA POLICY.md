The only data we store is strictly related to **in-game functionality**, including:
- Tank configurations and customizations

- Match history and gameplay progression

This information is stored solely for the purpose of enhancing the game experience.

## 3. Account Management

User account creation, login, and authentication are managed entirely through **Steam**. We do not process, collect, or store your login credentials, payment information, or personal data.

We use your unique **Steam ID** only to:
- Identify and load your saved game profile  
- Track your in-game progress and stats

All personal data is handled securely by Steam, in accordance with their privacy policies and infrastructure.

## 4. Children’s Privacy

**Armoured Division** is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store any data from users under 13 years of age. Our reliance on Steam account authentication ensures compliance with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**, as Steam’s platform enforces age-related access controls.

If we become aware of any unintended data collection involving a child, we will promptly delete that data.

## 5. Compliance with Privacy Laws

We design our data practices to comply with major international privacy laws, including:

- **GDPR (EU)** – We do not store personally identifiable information and respect the privacy rights of EU players.  
- **CCPA (California)** – We do not collect or sell personal data and support the rights of California users regarding transparency and deletion.  
- **COPPA (USA)** – We avoid collecting any personal data from children under 13 and do not target our game at that audience.

By minimizing the data we collect and relying on trusted platform services, we reduce the risk of privacy breaches and ensure compliance with these standards.

## 6. Data Security

While we do not store sensitive personal data, all game-related data is stored securely using best practices to protect against unauthorized access, manipulation, or loss. We monitor systems for integrity and take action to safeguard your in-game progress and fairness.
