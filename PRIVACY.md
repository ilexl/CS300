# Privacy and Data Use Policy – Armoured Division

_Last updated: 07/06/2025_

## 1. Overview

We at **Armoured Division** are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with care. This privacy policy outlines what data we collect, how it is used, and how we comply with global data protection regulations.

---

## 2. What We Collect

We do **not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII)** such as your name, email address, IP address, or contact details.

The only data we store is strictly related to **in-game functionality**, including:
- Tank configurations and customizations  
- Experience points, player level, and in-game stats  
- Match history and gameplay progression  
- A unique **Unity ID** assigned to your account for identifying game data

This information is used solely to enhance the game experience and maintain gameplay continuity.

---

## 3. Account Management

User account creation, login, and authentication are handled entirely by **Unity**. We do not process, collect, or store your login credentials, payment information, or personal data.

We store only the unique **Unity ID** assigned to your account. This ID is used to:
- Identify and load your saved game profile  
- Track your in-game progress and stats  
- Prevent duplication and ensure consistent gameplay across sessions

All other personal data is handled securely by Unity in accordance with their own privacy policies.

## 4. Children’s Privacy

**Armoured Division** is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from users under 13 years of age. Our reliance on Unity’s authentication system helps ensure compliance with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**, as Unity enforces age-related restrictions and protections.

If we become aware of any unintended data collection involving a child, we will promptly delete that data.

---

## 5. Compliance with Privacy Laws

We design our data practices to comply with major international privacy laws, including:

- **GDPR (EU)** – We do not store any personal data. Only a Unity-assigned unique ID and non-identifiable game-related data are stored. We respect the privacy rights of EU users and follow all GDPR requirements.  
- **CCPA (California)** – We do not collect or sell personal data. We store only the Unity ID and game progress data, and support users' rights to access, restrict, or delete their data.  
- **COPPA (USA)** – We do not target users under 13 and do not store any personal data. The only stored identifier is the Unity ID, which is not directly identifiable.

By minimizing the data we collect and relying on trusted third-party platforms, we reduce the risk of privacy breaches and ensure compliance with all applicable standards.

---

## 6. Data Security

Although we do not store personal data, all Unity IDs and in-game data are stored securely using industry best practices. We monitor systems for integrity and take all reasonable steps to protect against unauthorized access, manipulation, or loss.
